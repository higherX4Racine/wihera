Description: The Higher Education Regional Alliance (www.herawisconsin.org) is a
    coalition of schools in southeastern Wisconsin. Each school submits annual
    data dumps to Higher Expectations for Racine County (www.higherexpectationsracinecounty.org),
    which is responsible for validating, collating, and reporting the data.
    These reports generally take the form of web dashboards or printed handouts.
